## About TABAnimated

The origin version of `TABAnimated` is the dynamic effect of the skeleton screen of the [jianshu](https://www.jianshu.com/) web page.
I have explored the template mode in v1.9, but the repetitive workload is not conducive to rapid construction.
Moreover, the existence of the two modes is unreasonable, so this setting is deleted in v2.1, but the appearance of the template mode to delete is not unproductive, but instead brings a more reasonable implementation scheme and a more convenient construction method.

## Implementation Principle

`TABAnimated` requires a control view to make the switch animation. All subViews under this control view will be added to the animation queue.

`TABAnimated` creates `TABCompentLayer` by controlling the position of the subViews of the view and related information.
Normal control view with a `TABLayer`
Table view, each cell has a `TABLayer`
`TABLayer` is responsible for managing and displaying all `TABCompentLayer`.

When using constraints for layout, if the constraints are insufficient and there is no data, the location information of subViews will not be reflected, and TABAnimated will pre-populate the data.

## Benefits

- Rapid integration
- Zero coupling, easy to wrap its animation logic into the base library
- High performance with minimal memory loss
- Chained syntax, fast and easy to read
- Fully customizable to fit 99.99% view

## Evolution Process

Can't see clearly, you can zoom in

![origin.png](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/5632003-8a373e3d07820664.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

**Briefly explain**:

The first picture: the original table component, the display situation when there is data

The second picture: is the animation group mapped after the table component starts the animation. I believe you can see that the effect is not very beautiful.

The third picture: for this unsightly animation group, through the callback, pre-processing, the following description

## Installation

#### Using CocoaPods

```
Pod 'TABAnimated'
```

#### Manual Import

Drag the TABAnimated folder into the project.

## Usage

You only need four steps

1. Initialize `TABAimated` in `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`

There are other global properties, which are presented below in a table.

```
// init `TABAnimated`, and set the properties you need.
[[TABAnimated sharedAnimated] initWithOnlySkeleton];
// open log
[TABAnimated sharedAnimated].openLog = YES;
```

2. Control view initialization tabAnimated

Ordinary view:

```
self.mainView.tabAnimated = TABViewAnimated.new;
self.mainView.tabAnimated.categoryBlock = ^(UIView * _Nonnull view) {
        View.animation(1).width(200);
        View.animation(2).width(220);
        View.animation(3).width(180);
 };
```

Table component:

```
_collectionView.tabAnimated =
[TABCollectionAnimated animatedWithCellClass:[NewsCollectionViewCell class]
                                    cellSize:[NewsCollectionViewCell cellSize]];
_collectionView.tabAnimated.categoryBlock = ^(UIView * _Nonnull view) {
        View.animation(1).reducedWidth(20).down(2);
        View.animation(2).reducedWidth(-10).up(1);
        View.animation(3).down(5).line(4);
        View.animations(4,3).radius(3).down(5);
};
```

3. Turn on the animation

```
[self.collectionView tab_startAnimation];
```

4. Turn off the animation

```
[self.collectionView tab_endAnimation];
```

UIView corresponds to `TABViewAnimated`

UITableView corresponds to `TABTableAnimated`

UICollectionView corresponds to `TABCollectionAnimated`

There are also other initialization methods that support multiple sections.

In general, the registered cell can be mapped with the original cell.

**Special application scenarios**:

For example, there are many types of Sina Weibo post pages.
Such a complicated page, rising to the animation level is definitely to design a unified animation.
At this time, you can rewrite a cell, then register to the form, and map out the visual effects you want through this framework. This is also the evolution of the template function.

For additional details, continue to add additional documentation or view it on the github demo.

## Extended Callback

The extension callback gives the animation group to the developer, which the developer can adjust.
Because it is an adjustment, the chain syntax is added to allow developers to adjust quickly and easily.

```
_collectionView.tabAnimated.categoryBlock = ^(UIView * _Nonnull view) {
        View.animation(1).reducedWidth(20).down(2);
        View.animation(2).reducedWidth(-10).up(1);
        View.animation(3).down(5).line(4);
        View.animations(4,3).radius(3).down(5);
};
```

**Parameter description** (also detailed in the framework)

**view.animation(x)**: The animation of the specified subscript of the view `TABCompentLayer`

**view.animations(x,x)**: An array of animated individuals of the specified range of the view for uniform adjustment

**up(x)**: How much to move up

**down(x)**: How much to move down

**left(x)**: How many moves to the left

**right(x)**: How many moves to the right

**height(x)**: modify height

**Width(x)**: modify the width

**reducedWidth(x)**: How much is the width compared to before

**reducedHeight(x)**: How much is the height compared to before

**radius(x)**: rounded corners

**line(x)**: number of lines

**space(x)**: spacing

These two parameters, if it is multi-line text, take effect by default according to the number of `numberOfLines`
Ordinary animated individuals can also set these two properties to achieve the same effect.

**remove()**: Move out the animation group

**toLongAnimation()**: Give the individual a dynamic variable length animation

**toShortAnimation()**: Give the individual a dynamic shortening animation

**lastScale(x)**: the width ratio of the last line for multiple lines of label, default 0.5

special reminder:

> + In the `TABAnimated.h` file, there are global animation parameters
> + In `TABViewAnimated.h`, there are parameters for all animations in the control view
> + The above chained grammar, modified by specific animated individuals

priority:

Animated Individual Parameter Configuration > Control View Animation Parameter Configuration > Global Animation Parameter Configuration

## Drop Animation

1. **dropIndex(xxx)**: means the subscript setting for discoloration,
In general, if you don't set it up, the framework will be set up in the order in which the views are added to the view, which of course is far from satisfactory.

for example：
![example.png](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/5632003-0c3bc10031c629a3.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/400)

The first three animation elements in this effect are discolored together, and are the first color change, that is, the color change subscript is 0.
If you follow the default settings of the framework, then their color-changing subscripts are 0, 1, 2, respectively.
Obviously not meeting the demand.

At this time, you have to set it by **dropIndex(xxx)**.
The framework is available in 2 ways:

```
view.animations(0,3).dropIndex(0);
```
```
view.animation(0).dropIndex(0);
view.animation(1).dropIndex(0);
view.animation(2).dropIndex(0);
```

2. Falling multiple lines of label in an animation

![929722EC-1C28-4EE1-A711-802B0AD64CAD.png](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/5632003-ecd594f1ed5a2660.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/400)

All skeletons of the framework are mapped based on your original view.
If your view is `UILabel` and `numberOfLines` is not 1, then the frame will be considered as multiple lines of text.
At this point, it involves two chained grammars.

**lines(xxx)**, meaning to modify the number of lines in the red box

**space(xxx)**, meaning to modify the spacing in the red box

Of course, if an ordinary element can also be set to achieve the same effect, do you understand? ? ?

At this point, it is only the old content, in case some children have not used it, do not understand.

Based on this particularity,
**dropFromIndex(xxx)** came into being, meaning that the three elements in the red box start to change color from the subscript xxx

**Specific point: view.animation(xxx).lines(3).dropFromIndex(3);
Means: Three elements in the red frame, the first color change subscript is 3, the second color change subscript is 4, and the third color change subscript is 5. **

3. **removeOnDrop()**: means that the animated element does not wish to participate in discoloration

4. **dropStayTime(xxx)**: color retention time ratio, default 0.2

## Tips

1. Q: Which animation component corresponds to which component?

answer:

If you build with pure code, then you add the subscripts of the animation array corresponding to the component order,
For example, if the first one is added to the cell, then its corresponding animation component is: view.animation(0)
And so on, just open your cell file and look at the hierarchy to make adjustments.

However, if you create with xib, it's a pity to tell you that the order is the order in which the xib files are associated.
The xib in the demo did a wrong demonstration, and there was a pit of caution.
There are no other good ways to find it, and I hope to collect your suggestions.

2. `UILabel` with Multi-line

![line.png](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/5632003-866d8adb77e4310c.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

As mentioned above, here again,
You can use .line(x) to set the number of lines. space(x) to set the spacing.
Each animation component can set these two properties to achieve the same effect.

3. Specify the initialization method of section loading animation

For example, animatedSectionArray = @[@(3), @(4)];

This means the first element in the cellHeightArray, animatedCountArray, cellClassArray, is the animation data when section == 3.

```
// Some sections have animations

_tableView.tabAnimated =
[TABTableAnimated animated WithCellClassArray:@[[TestTableViewCell class]]
                              cellHeightArray:@[@(100)]
                           animatedCountArray:@[@(1)]
                         animatedSectionArray:@[@(1)];

_tableView.tabAnimated.categoryBlock = ^(UIView * _Nonnull view){
    view.animation(1).down(3).height (12).toShortAnimation();
    view.animation(2).height(12).width(110).toLongAnimation();
    view.animation(3).down(-5).height(12);
}
```

4. Expand the callback when using multiple sections

```
_collectionView.tabAnimated.categoryBlock = ^(UIView * _Nonnull view) {
            
      If ([view isKindOfClass:[CourseCollectionViewCell class]]) {

      }
            
      If ([view isKindOfClass:[DailyCollectionViewCell class]]) {
            View.animations(1,3).height(14);
            View.animation(2).down(6);
            View.animation(1).up(1);
            View.animation(3).up(6);
      }
  };
```

5. For nested table components, the `isNest` attribute of the table component to be nested needs to be set to `YES`. See demo for details.

```
_collectionView.tabAnimated = [[TABAnimatedObject alloc] init];
_collectionView.tabAnimated.isNest = YES;
_collectionView.tabAnimated.animatedCount = 3;
```

6. Specify section end animation
```
/**
  Ending animation for a specific partition, there is no animation in all partitions, it will automatically be set to end animation state

  @param section Specify section
  */
- (void)tab_endAnimationWithSection:(NSInteger)section;
```
